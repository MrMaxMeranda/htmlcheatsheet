HTML ELEMENTS REFERENCE

MAIN ROOT:
<html>		The HTML <html> element represents the
		root (top-level element) of an HTML
		document, so it is also referred to as
		the root element. All other elements
		must be descendants of this element.

DOCUMENT METADATA:
Styles, scripts and data to help software (search
engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page.
Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the
page or link to another file that has the information.
<link> 		Specifies relationships between the
		current document and an external
		resource. Possible uses for this
		element include defining a relational
		framework for navigation. This element
		is most used to link to style sheets.
<meta> 		Represents metadata that cannot be
		represented by other HTML meta-related
		elements, like <base>, <link>,
		<script>, <style> or <title>.
<style> 	Contains style information for a
		document, or part of a document.

SECTIONING ROOT:
<body>		Represents the content of an HTML
		document. There can be only one <body>
		element in a document.

CONTENT SECTIONING:

Allows you to organize the document content into
logical pieces. Use this to create a broad outline for
your page content, including header and footer
navigation, and heading elements to identify sections
of content.
<article>	Represents a self-contained composition
		in a document, page, application, or
		site, which is intended to be
		independently distributable or reusable
		(e.g., in syndication). Examples
		include: a forum post, a magazine or
		newspaper article, or a blog entry.
-<address>	Indicates that the enclosed HTML
		provides contact information for a
		person or people, or for an
		organization.
<aside> 	Represents a portion of a document
		whose content is only indirectly
		related to the document's main content.
<footer> 	The HTML <footer> element represents a
		footer for its nearest sectioning
		content or sectioning root element. A
		footer typically contains information
		about the author of the section,
		copyright data or links to related
		documents.
<header> 	Represents introductory content,
		typically a group of introductory or
		navigational aids. It may contain some
		heading elements but also other
		elements like a logo, a search form, an
		author name, and so on.
<hgroup>	Represents a multi-level heading for a
		section of a document. It groups a set
		of <h1> to <h6> elements.
<h1>, <h2>,	The HTML <h1> to <h6> elements represent
<h3>, <h4>,	six levels of section headings. <h1> is
<h5>, <h6> 	the highest section level and <h6> is
		the lowest.
<nav>		Represents a section of a page whose
		purpose is to provide navigation links,
		either within the current document or
		to other documents. Common examples of
		navigation sections are menus, tables
		of contents, and indexes.
<section>	Represents a standalone section — which
		doesn't have a more specific semantic
		element to represent it — contained
		within an HTML document.

TEXT CONTENT:

Use HTML text content elements to organise blocks or
sections of content placed between the opening <body>
and closing </body> tags. Important for accessibility
and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or
structure of that content.
<blockquote> 	Indicates that the enclosed text is an
		extended quotation. Usually, this is
		rendered visually by indentation. A URL
		for the source of the quotation may be
		given using the cite attribute, while a
		text representation of the source can
		be given using the <cite> element.
<dl>		Represents a description list. The
		element encloses a list of groups of
		terms (specified using the <dt>
		element) and descriptions. (provided by
		<dd> elements). Common uses for this
		element are to implement a glossary or
		to display metadata (a list of
		key-value pairs).
-<dt> 		Specifies a term in a description or
		definition list, and as such must be
		used inside a <dl> element.
-<dd> 		Provides the details about or the
		definition of the preceding term (<dt>)
		in a description list (<dl>).
<dir> 		Obsolete. Is used as a container for a
		directory of files and/or folders,
		potentially with styles and icons
		applied by the user agent.
<div> 		Generic container for flow content. It
		has no effect on the content or layout
		until styled using CSS.
<figure>	Represents self-contained content,
		frequently with a caption
		(<figcaption>), and is typically
		referenced as a single unit.
-<figcaption> 	Represents a caption or a legend
		associated with a figure or an
		illustration described by the rest of
		the data of the <figure> element which
		is its immediate ancestor.
<hr>		Represents a thematic break between
		paragraph-level elements (for example,
		a change of scene in a story, or a
		shift of topic with a section);
		historically, this has been presented
		as a horizontal rule or line.
<main>		Represents the main content of the
		<body> of a document, portion of a
		document, or application. The main
		content area consists of content that
		is directly related to, or expands upon
		the central topic of, a document or the
		central functionality of an
		application.
<ol>		Represents an ordered list of items,
		typically rendered as a numbered list.
<ul>		Represents an unordered list of items,
		typically rendered as a bulleted list.
-<li> 		Is used to represent an item in a list.
		It must be contained in a parent
		element: an ordered list (<ol>), an
		unordered list (<ul>), or a menu
		(<menu>). In menus and unordered lists,
		list items are usually displayed using
		bullet points. In ordered lists, they
		are usually displayed with an ascending
		counter on the left, such as a number
		or letter.
<p>		Represents a paragraph of text.
<pre> 		Represents preformatted text which is
		to be presented exactly as written in
		the HTML file.

INLINE TEXT SEMANTICS:

Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the
meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any
arbitrary piece of text.
<a>		Creates a hyperlink to other web pages,
		files, locations within the same page,
		email addresses, or any other URL.
<abbr>		Represents an abbreviation and
		optionally provides a full description
		for it. If present, the title attribute
		must contain this full description and
		nothing else.
<b>		Is used to draw the reader's attention
		to the element's contents, which are
		not otherwise granted special
		importance.
<bdi>		Isolates a span of text that might be
		formatted in a different direction from
		other text outside it.
<bdo>		Overrides the current directionality of
		text, so that the text within is
		rendered in a different direction.
<br>		Produces a line break in text
		(carriage-return). It is useful for
		writing a poem or an address, where the
		division of lines is significant.
<cite>		Is used to describe a reference to a
		cited creative work, and must include
		either the title or the URL of that
		work.
<code>		Displays its contents styled in a
		fashion intended to indicate that the
		text is a short fragment of computer
		code.
<data>		Links a given content with a
		machine-readable translation. If the
		content is time- or date-related, the
		<time> element must be used.
<dfn>		Is used to mark the usage instance of
		the enclosed term which is itself
		included within the definition of that
		term.
<em>		Marks text that has stress emphasis.
		The <em> element can be nested, with
		each level of nesting indicating a
		greater degree of emphasis.
<i>		Represents a range of text that is set
		off from the normal text for some
		reason, for example, technical terms,
		foreign language phrases, or fictional
		character thoughts. It is typically
		displayed in italic type.
<kbd>		Represents user input and produces an
		inline element displayed in the
		browser's default monospace font.
<nobr>		Obsolete element prevents the text it
		contains from automatically wrapping
		across multiple lines, potentially
		resulting in the user having to scroll
		horizontally to see the entire width of
		the text.
<mark>		Represents highlighted text, i.e., a
		run of text marked for reference
		purpose, due to its relevance in a
		particular context.
<q>		Indicates that the enclosed text is a
		short inline quotation. Most modern
		browsers implement this by surrounding
		the text in quotation marks.
<ruby>		Represents a ruby annotation. Ruby
		annotations are for showing
		pronunciation of East Asian characters.
-<rp>		(Ruby Fallback Parenthesis) element is
		used to provide fall-back parentheses
		for browsers that do not support
		display of ruby annotations using the
		<ruby> element.
-<rt>		(HTML Ruby Text) element specifies the
		ruby text component of a ruby
		annotation, which is used to provide
		pronunciation, translation, or
		transliteration information for East
		Asian typography. The <rt> element must
		always be contained within a <ruby>
		element.
-<rtc>		(HTML Ruby Text Container) element
		embraces semantic annotations of
		characters presented in a ruby of <rb>
		elements used inside of <ruby> element.
		<rb> elements can have both
		pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic
		(<rtc>) annotations.
<s>		Renders text with a strikethrough, or a
		line through it. Use the <s> element to
		represent things that are no longer
		relevant or no longer accurate.
		However, <s> is not appropriate when
		indicating document edits; for that,
		use the <del> and <ins> elements, as
		appropriate.
<samp>		An element intended to identify sample
		output from a computer program. It is
		usually displayed in the browser's
		default monotype font (such as Lucida
		Console).
<small> 	Makes the text font size one size
		smaller (for example, from large to
		medium, or from small to x-small) down
		to the browser's minimum font size.  In
		HTML5, this element is repurposed to
		represent side-comments and small
		print, including copyright and legal
		text, independent of its styled
		presentation.
<span>		Generic inline container for phrasing
		content, which does not inherently
		represent anything. It can be used to
		group elements for styling purposes
		(using the class or id attributes), or
		because they share attribute values,
		such as lang.
<strong> 	Gives text strong importance and is
		typically displayed in bold.
<sub> 		Defines a span of text that should be
		displayed, for typographic reasons,
		lower, and often smaller, than the main
		span of text.
<sup> 		Defines a span of text that should be
		displayed, for typographic reasons,
		higher, and often smaller, than the
		main span of text.
<time>		Represents either a time on a 24-hour
		clock or a precise date in the
		Gregorian calendar (with optional time
		and timezone information).
<u> 		Renders text with an underline, a line
		under the baseline of its content. In
		HTML5, this element represents a span
		of text with an unarticulated, though
		explicitly rendered, non-textual
		annotation, such as labeling the text
		as being a proper name in Chinese text
		(a Chinese proper name mark), or
		labeling the text as being misspelled.
<var>		Represents a variable in a mathematical
		expression or a programming context.
<wbr>		Represents a word break opportunity—a
		position within text where the browser
		may optionally break a line, though its
		line-breaking rules would not otherwise
		create a break at that location.

IMAGE AND MULTIMEDIA:

HTML supports various multimedia resources such as
images, audio, and video.
<audio>		Is used to embed sound content in
		documents. It may contain one or more
		audio sources, represented using the
		src attribute or the <source> element:
		the browser will choose the most
		suitable one. It can also be the
		destination for streamed media, using a
		MediaStream.
<video> 	Embed video content in a document.
-<track> 	Is used as a child of the media
		elements <audio> and <video>. It lets
		you specify timed text tracks (or
		time-based data), for example to
		automatically handle subtitles. The
		tracks are formatted in WebVTT format
		(.vtt files) — Web Video Text Tracks.
<img>		Embeds an image into the document.
<map>		Is used with <area> elements to define
		an image map (a clickable link area).
-<area>		Defines a hot-spot region on an image,
		and optionally associates it with a
		hypertext link. This element is used
		only within a <map> element.

EMBEDDED CONTENT:

In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can
include a variety of other content, even if it's not
always easy to interact with.
<applet> 	An obsolete Applet Element that embeds
		a Java applet into the document; this
		element has been deprecated in favour
		of <object>.
<embed> 	Embeds external content at the
		specified point in the document. This
		content is provided by an external
		application or other source of
		interactive content such as a browser
		plug-in.
<noembed>	An obsolete, non-standard way to provide
		alternative, or "fallback", content for
		browsers that do not support the
		<embed> element or do not support the
		type of embedded content an author
		wishes to use.
<object> 	The HTML <object> element represents an
		external resource, which can be treated
		as an image, a nested browsing context,
		or a resource to be handled by a
		plugin.
<param> 	Defines parameters for an <object>
		element.
<picture> 	Serves as a container for zero
		or more <source> elements and one <img>
		element to provide versions of an image
		for different display device scenarios.
-<source> 	Specifies multiple media resources for
		the <picture>, the <audio>, or the
		<video> element. It is an empty
		element. It is commonly used to serve
		the same media content in multiple
		formats supported by different
		browsers.

SCRIPTING:

In order to create dynamic content and Web
applications, HTML supports the use of scripting
languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain
elements support this capability.
<canvas> 	Use with either the canvas scripting
		API or the WebGL API to draw graphics
		and animations.
<noscript> 	Defines a section of HTML to be
		inserted if a script type on the page
		is unsupported or if scripting is
		currently turned off in the browser.
<script> 	Used to embed or reference executable
		code; this is typically used to embed
		or refer to JavaScript code.

DEMARCATING EDITS:

These elements let you provide indications that
specific parts of the text have been altered.
<del> 		Represents a range of text that has
		been deleted from a document.
<ins> 		Represents a range of text that has
		been added to a document.

TABLE CONTENT:

The elements here are used to create and handle tabular
data.
<table> 	Represents tabular data — that is,
		information presented in a
		two-dimensional table comprised of rows
		and columns of cells containing data.
-<caption> 	This table element specifies the
		caption (or title) of a table, and if
		used is always the first child of a
		<table>.
-<thead>	Defines a set of rows defining the head
		of the columns of the table.
-<tbody> 	Groups one or more <tr> elements as the
		body of a <table> element.
-<tfoot> 	Defines a set of rows summarising the
		columns of the table.
-<colgroup> 	Defines a group of columns within a
		table.
--<col> 	Defines a column within a table and is
		used for defining common semantics on
		all common cells.  It is generally
		found within a <colgroup> element.
-<tr> 		Specifies that the markup contained
		inside the <tr> block comprises one row
		of a table, inside which the <th> and
		<td> elements create header and data
		cells, respectively, within the row.
--<th>		Defines a cell as header of a group of
		table cells. The exact nature of this
		group is defined by the scope and
		headers attributes.
--<td> 		Defines a cell of a table that contains
		data. It participates in the table model.

FORMS:

HTML provides a number of elements which can be used
together to create forms which the user can fill out
and submit to the Web site or application. There's a
great deal of further information about this available
in the HTML forms guide.
<form>		Represents a document section that
		contains interactive controls to submit
		information to a web server.
<button> 	Represents a clickable button, which
		can be used in forms, or anywhere in a
		document that needs simple, standard
		button functionality.
<fieldset> 	The HTML <fieldset> element is used to
		group several controls as well as
		labels (<label>) within a web form.
-<legend> 	Element represents a caption for the
		content of its parent <fieldset>.
<label> 	Represents a caption for an item in a
		user interface.
<select>	Represents a control that provides a
		menu of options:
<datalist>	Contains a set of <option> elements
		that represent the values available for
		other controls.
-<optgroup>	Creates a grouping of options within a
		<select> element.
-<option> 	Is used to define an item contained in
		a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a
		<datalist> element. As such, <option>
		can represent menu items in popups and
		other lists of items in an HTML
		document.
<input> 	Is used to create interactive controls
		for web-based forms in order to accept
		data from the user.
<output> 	A container element into which a site
		or app can inject the results of a
		calculation or the outcome of a user
		action.
<meter> 	Represents either a scalar value within
		a known range or a fractional value.
<progress> 	Displays an indicator showing the
		completion progress of a task,
		typically displayed as a progress bar.
<textarea> 	Represents a multi-line plain-text
		editing control.

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:

HTML offers a selection of elements which help to
create interactive user interface objects.
<dialog> 	Represents a dialog box or other
		interactive component, such as an
		inspector or window.
<details> 	Is used as a disclosure widget from
		which the user can retrieve additional
		information.
-<summary>	Is used as a summary, caption, or
		legend for the content of a <details>
		element.
<menu>		Obsolete. Represents a group of
		commands that a user can perform or
		activate. This includes both list
		menus, which might appear across the
		top of a screen, as well as context
		menus, such as those that might appear
		underneath a button after it has been
		clicked.
-<menuitem>	Obsolete. Represents a command that a
		user is able to invoke through a popup
		menu.  This includes context menus, as
		well as menus that might be attached to
		a menu button.

WEB COMPONENTS:

Web Components is an HTML-related technology which
makes it possible to, essentially, create and use
custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In
addition, you can create custom versions of standard
HTML elements.
<content>	Obsolete part of the Web Components
		suite of technologies—was used inside
		of Shadow DOM as an insertion point,
		and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary
		HTML.
<element> 	Obsolete. Was part of the Web
		Components specification; it was
		intended to be used to define new
		custom DOM elements.
<shadow> 	Obsolete part of the Web Components
		technology suite—was intended to be
		used as a shadow DOM insertion point.
		You might have used it if you have
		created multiple shadow roots under a
		shadow host. It is not useful in
		ordinary HTML.
<slot>		Element—part of the Web Components
		technology suite—is a placeholder
		inside a web component that you can
		fill with your own markup, which lets
		you create separate DOM trees and
		present them together.
<template>	Is a mechanism for holding client-side
		content that is not to be rendered when
		a page is loaded, but may subsequently
		be instantiated during runtime using
		JavaScript.

OBSOLETE AND DEPRECATED ELEMENTS:

Warning: These are old HTML elements which are
deprecated and should not be used. You should never use
them in new projects, and should replace them in old
projects as soon as you can. They are listed here for
informational purposes only.
<acronym>	Allows authors to clearly indicate a
		sequence of characters that compose an
		acronym or abbreviation for a word.
		This element has been removed in HTML5.
		Use <abbr> element.
<applet> 	Embeds a Java applet into the document;
		this element has been deprecated in
		favor of <object>.
<basefont> 	Sets a default font face, size, and
		colour for the other elements which are
		descended from its parent element.
<bgsound> 	Internet Explorer only. Sets up a sound
		file to play in the background while
		the page is used; use <audio> instead.
<big> 		Renders the enclosed text at a font
		size one level larger than the
		surrounding text (medium becomes large,
		for example).
<blink> 	A non-standard element which causes the
		enclosed text to flash slowly.
<center> 	A block-level element that displays its
		block-level or inline contents centred
		horizontally within its containing
		element.
<command>	Represents a command which the user can
		invoke. Commands are often used as part
		of a context menu or toolbar.
<content>	Part of the Web Components suite of
		technologies—was used inside of Shadow
		DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't
		meant to be used in ordinary HTML.
<dir>		Used as a container for a directory of
		files and/or folders, potentially with
		styles and icons applied by the user
		agent.
<element> 	Was part of the Web Components
		specification; it was intended to be
		used to define new custom DOM elements.
<font>		Defines the font size, colour and face
		for its content.
<frameset>	Used to contain <frame> elements.
-<frame> 	Defines a particular area in which
		another HTML document can be displayed.
		A frame should be used within a
		<frameset>.
<image>		Remnant of an ancient version of HTML
		lost in the mists of time; use the
		standard <img> element instead.
<isindex>	Puts a text field in a page for
		querying the document.
<keygen> 	To facilitate generation of key
		material, and submission of the public
		key as part of an HTML form. This
		mechanism is designed for use with
		Web-based certificate management
		systems. It is expected that the
		<keygen> element will be used in an
		HTML form along with other information
		needed to construct a certificate
		request, and that the result of the
		process will be a signed certificate.
<listing>	Renders text between the start and end
		tags without interpreting the HTML in
		between and using a monospaced font.
		The HTML 2 standard recommended that
		lines shouldn't be broken when not
		greater than 132 characters.
<marquee>	Used to insert a scrolling area of
		text. You can control what happens when
		the text reaches the edges of its
		content area using its attributes.
<multicol> 	An experimental element designed to
		allow multi-column layouts. It never
		got any significant traction and is not
		implemented in any major browsers.
<nextid> 	An obsolete HTML element that served to
		enable the NeXT web designing tool to
		generate automatic NAME labels for its
		anchors.
<nobr>		Prevents the text it contains from
		automatically wrapping across multiple
		lines, potentially resulting in the
		user having to scroll horizontally to
		see the entire width of the text.
<noembed> 	An obsolete, non-standard way to
		provide alternative, or "fallback",
		content for browsers that do not
		support the <embed> element or do not
		support the type of embedded content an
		author wishes to use.
<noframes>	Provides content to be presented in
		browsers that don't support (or have
		disabled support for) the <frame>
		element.
<plaintext> 	Renders everything following the start
		tag as raw text, without interpreting
		any HTML. There is no closing tag,
		since everything after it is considered
		raw text.
<shadow> 	Part of the Web Components technology
		suite—was intended to be used as a
		shadow DOM insertion point. You might
		have used it if you have created
		multiple shadow roots under a shadow
		host. It is not useful in ordinary
		HTML.
<spacer>	Allowed insertion of empty spaces on
		pages. It was devised by Netscape to
		accomplish the same effect as a
		single-pixel layout image, which was
		something web designers used to use to
		add white spaces to web pages without
		actually using an image. However,
		<spacer> no longer supported by any
		major browser and the same effects can
		now be achieved using simple CSS.
<strike>	Places a strikethrough (horizontal
		line) over text.
<tt>		Produces an inline element displayed in
		the browser's default monotype font.
		This element was intended to style text
		as it would display on a fixed width
		display, such as a teletype. It
		probably is more common to display
		fixed width type using the <code>
		element.
<xmp>		Renders text between the start and end
		tags without interpreting the HTML in
		between and using a monospaced font.
		The HTML2 specification recommended
		that it should be rendered wide enough
		to allow 80 characters per line.

<input> ATTRIBUTES:

Global <input> attributes

This section lists the attributes available to all form
<input> types. Non-global attributes — and global
attributes that behave differently when specified on
different <input> types — are listed on those types'
individual pages.

Note: This includes the global HTML attributes.

type 		The type of control to render. See Form
		<input> types for the individual types,
		with links to more information about
		each.
accept  	If the value of the type attribute is

autofocus	HTML5 This Boolean attribute lets you
		specify that a form control should have
		input focus when the page loads, unless
		the user overrides it (e.g. by typing
		in a different control). Only one form
		element in a document can have the
		autofocus attribute, which is a
		Boolean.  It cannot be applied if the
		type attribute is set to hidden (that
		is, you cannot automatically set focus
		to a hidden control). Note that the
		focusing of the control may occur
		before the firing of the
		DOMContentLoaded event.
capture 	When the value of the type attribute is
		file, the presence of this Boolean
		attribute indicates that capture of
		media directly from the device's
		environment using a media capture
		mechanism is preferred.
checked 	When the value of the type attribute is
		radio or checkbox, the presence of this
		Boolean attribute indicates that the
		control is selected by default,
		otherwise it is ignored.
disabled 	This Boolean attribute indicates that
		the form control is not available for
		interaction. In particular, the click
		event will not be dispatched on
		disabled controls. Also, a disabled
		control's value isn't submitted with
		the form.
form 		HTML5 The form element that the input
		element is associated with (its form
		owner). The value of the attribute must
		be an id of a <form> element in the
		same document. If this attribute is not
		specified, this <input> element must be
		a descendant of a <form> element. This
		attribute enables you to place <input>
		elements anywhere within a document,
		not just as descendants of their form
		elements. An input can only be
		associated with one form.
formaction 	HTML5 The URI of a program that
		processes the information submitted by
		the input element, if it is a submit
		button or image. If specified, it
		overrides the action attribute of the
		element's form owner.
formenctype 	HTML5 If the input element is a submit
		button or image, this attribute
		specifies the type of content that is
		used to submit the form to the server.
		Possible values are:
		* application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
		  The default value if the attribute is
		  not specified.
		* multipart/form-data: Use this value
		  if you are using an <input> element
		  with the type attribute set to file.
        	* text/plain
		If this attribute is specified, it
		overrides the enctype attribute of the
		element's form owner.
formmethod 	HTML5 If the input element is a submit
		button or image, this attribute
		specifies the HTTP method that the
		browser uses to submit the form.
		Possible values are:
		* post: The data from the form is
		  included in the body of the form and
		  is sent to the server.
		* get: The data from the form are
		  appended to the form attribute URI,
		  with a '?' as a separator, and the
		  resulting URI is sent to the server.
		  Use this method when the form has no
		  side-effects and contains only ASCII
		  characters.
		If specified, this attribute overrides
		the method attribute of the element's
		form owner.
formnovalidate 	HTML5 If the input element is a submit
		button or image, this Boolean attribute
		specifies that the form is not to be
		validated when it is submitted. If this
		attribute is specified, it overrides
		the novalidate attribute of the
		element's form owner.
formtarget 	HTML5 If the input element is a submit
		button or image, this attribute is a
		name or keyword indicating where to
		display the response that is received
		after submitting the form. This is a
		name of, or keyword for, a browsing
		context (e.g. tab, window, or inline
		frame). If this attribute is specified,
		it overrides the target attribute of
		the elements's form owner. The
		following keywords have special
		meanings:
		* _self: Load the response into the
		  same browsing context as the current
		  one. This value is the default if the
		  attribute is not specified.
		* _blank: Load the response into a new
		  unnamed browsing context.
		* _parent: Load the response into the
		  parent browsing context of the
		  current one. If there is no parent,
		  this option behaves the same way as
		  _self.
		* _top: Load the response into the
		  top-level browsing context (i.e. the
		  browsing context that is an ancestor
		  of the current one, and has no
		  parent). If there is no parent, this
		  option behaves the same way as _self.
height 		HTML5 If the value of the type
		attribute is image, this attribute
		defines the height of the image
		displayed for the button.
inputmode 	HTML5 Obsolete since HTML5.2 A hint to
		the browser for which keyboard to
		display. This attribute applies when
		the value of the type attribute is
		text, password, email, or url.
		Possible values are:
		* verbatim: Alphanumeric, non-prose
		  content such as usernames and
		  passwords.
		* latin: Latin-script input in the
		  user's preferred language with typing
		  aids such as text prediction enabled.
		  For human-to-computer communication
		  such as search boxes.
		* latin-name: As latin, but for human
		  names.
		* latin-prose: As latin, but with more
		  aggressive typing aids. For
		  human-to-human communication such as
		  instant messaging or email.
		* full-width-latin: As latin-prose, but
		  for the user's secondary languages.
		* kana: Kana or romaji input, typically
		  hiragana input, using full-width
		  characters, with support for
		  converting to kanji. Intended for
		  Japanese text input.
		* katakana: Katakana input, using
		  full-width characters, with support
		  for converting to kanji.  Intended
		  for Japanese text input.
		* numeric: Numeric input, including
		  keys for the digits 0 to 9, the
		  user's preferred thousands separator
		  character, and the character for
		  indicating negative numbers. Intended
		  for numeric codes (e.g. credit card
		  numbers). For actual numbers, prefer
		  using <input type="number">
		* tel: Telephone input, including
		  asterisk and pound key. Use <input
		  type="tel"> if possible instead.
		* email: Email input. Use <input
		  type="email"> if possible instead.
		* url: URL input. Use
		  <input type="url"> if possible
		  instead.

list 		HTML5 Identifies a list of pre-defined
		options to suggest to the user. The
		value must be the id of a <datalist>
		element in the same document. The
		browser displays only options that are
		valid values for this input element.
		This attribute is ignored when the type
		attribute's value is hidden, checkbox,
		radio, file, or a button type.
max 		HTML5 The maximum (numeric or
		date-time) value for this item, which
		must not be less than its minimum (min
		attribute) value.
maxlength 	If the value of the type attribute is
		text, email, search, password, tel, or
		url, this attribute specifies the
		maximum number of characters (in UTF-16
		code units) that the user can enter.
		For other control types, it is ignored.
		It can exceed the value of the size
		attribute.  If it is not specified, the
		user can enter an unlimited number of
		characters. Specifying a negative
		number results in the default behavior
		(i.e. the user can enter an unlimited
		number of characters). The constraint
		is evaluated only when the value of the
		attribute has been changed.
min 		HTML5 The minimum (numeric or
		date-time) value for this item, which
		must not be greater than its maximum
		(max attribute) value.
minlength 	HTML5 If the value of the type
		attribute is text, email, search,
		password, tel, or url, this attribute
		specifies the minimum number of
		characters (in Unicode code points)
		that the user can enter. For other
		control types, it is ignored.
multiple 	HTML5 This Boolean attribute indicates
		whether the user can enter more than
		one value. This attribute applies when
		the type attribute is set to email or
		file, otherwise it is ignored.
name 		The name of the control, which is
		submitted with the form data.
pattern 	HTML5 A regular expression that the
		control's value is checked against. The
		pattern must match the entire value,
		not just some subset. Use the title
		attribute to describe the pattern to
		help the user. This attribute applies
		when the value of the type attribute is
		text, search, tel, url, email, or
		password, otherwise it is ignored. The
		regular expression language is the same
		as JavaScript RegExp algorithm, with
		the 'u' parameter that makes it treat
		the pattern as a sequence of unicode
		code points. The pattern is not
		surrounded by forward slashes.
placeholder 	HTML5 A hint to the user of what can be
		entered in the control . The
		placeholder text must not contain
		carriage returns or line-feeds.
		Note: Do not use the placeholder
		attribute instead of a <label> element,
		their purposes are different. The
		<label> attribute describes the role of
		the form element (i.e. it indicates
		what kind of information is expected),
		and the placeholder attribute is a hint
		about the format that the content
		should take. There are cases in which
		the placeholder attribute is never
		displayed to the user, so the form must
		be understandable without it.
readonly 	HTML5 This attribute indicates that the
		user cannot modify the value of the
		control. The value of the attribute is
		irrelevant. If you need read-write
		access to the input value, do not add
		the "readonly" attribute. It is ignored
		if the value of the type attribute is
		hidden, range, color, checkbox, radio,
		file, or a button type (such as button
		or submit).
required 	HTML5 This attribute specifies that the
		user must fill in a value before
		submitting a form. It cannot be used
		when the type attribute is hidden,
		image, or a button type (submit, reset,
		or button). The :optional and :required
		CSS pseudo-classes will be applied to
		the field as appropriate.
selectionDirection HTML5 The direction in which
		selection occurred. This is "forward"
		if the selection was made from
		left-to-right in an LTR locale or
		right-to-left in an RTL locale, or
		"backward" if the selection was made in
		the opposite direction. On platforms on
		which it's possible this value isn't
		known, the value can be "none"; for
		example, on macOS, the default
		direction is "none", then as the user
		begins to modify the selection using
		the keyboard, this will change to
		reflect the direction in which the
		selection is expanding.
selectionEnd 	The offset into the element's text
		content of the last selected character.
		If there's no selection, this value
		indicates the offset to the character
		following the current text input cursor
		position (that is, the position the
		next character typed would occupy).
selectionStart 	The offset into the element's text
		content of the first selected
		character. If there's no selection,
		this value indicates the offset to the
		character following the current text
		input cursor position (that is, the
		position the next character typed would
		occupy).
size 		The initial size of the control. This
		value is in pixels unless the value of
		the type attribute is text or password,
		in which case it is an integer number
		of characters. Starting in HTML5, this
		attribute applies only when the type
		attribute is set to text, search, tel,
		url, email, or password, otherwise it
		is ignored.  In addition, the size must
		be greater than zero. If you do not
		specify a size, a default value of 20
		is used.  HTML5 simply states "the user
		agent should ensure that at least that
		many characters are visible", but
		different characters can have different
		widths in certain fonts. In some
		browsers, a certain string with x
		characters will not be entirely visible
		even if size is defined to at least x.
spellcheck 	HTML5 Setting the value of this
		attribute to true indicates that the
		element needs to have its spelling and
		grammar checked. The value default
		indicates that the element is to act
		according to a default behavior,
		possibly based on the parent element's
		own spellcheck value. The value false
		indicates that the element should not
		be checked.
src 		If the value of the type attribute is
		image, this attribute specifies a URI
		for the location of an image to display
		on the graphical submit button,
		otherwise it is ignored.
step 		HTML5 Works with the min and max
		attributes to limit the increments at
		which a numeric or date-time value can
		be set. It can be the string any or a
		positive floating point number. If this
		attribute is not set to any, the
		control accepts only values at
		multiples of the step value greater
		than the minimum.
tabindex 	element-specific in HTML 4, global in
		HTML5 The position of the element in
		the tabbing navigation order for the
		current document.
usemap 		HTML 4 only, Obsolete since HTML5 The
		name of a <map> element to be used as
		an image map.
value 		The initial value of the control. This
		attribute is optional except when the
		value of the type attribute is radio or
		checkbox. Note that when reloading the
		page, Gecko and IE will ignore the
		value specified in the HTML source, if
		the value was changed before the
		reload.
width 		HTML5 If the value of the type
		attribute is image, this attribute
		defines the width of the image
		displayed for the button.

NON-STANDARD <INPUT> ATTRIBUTES

autocapitalize 	This is a nonstandard attribute used by
		Chrome and iOS Safari Mobile, which
		controls whether and how the text value
		should be automatically capitalized as
		it is entered/edited by the user. The
		non-deprecated values are available in
		iOS 5 and later. Possible values are:
		* none: Completely disables automatic
		  capitalisation.
		* sentences: Automatically capitalise
		  the first letter of sentences.
		* words: Automatically capitalise the
		  first letter of words.
		* characters: Automatically capitalise
		  all characters.
        	* on: Deprecated since iOS 5.
        	* off: Deprecated since iOS 5.
autocorrect 	This is a non-standard attribute
		supported by Safari that is used to
		control whether autocorrection should
		be enabled when the user is
		entering/editing the text value of the
		<input>. Possible attribute values are:
        	* on: Enable autocorrection.
        	* off: Disable autocorrection.
incremental 	This is a nonstandard attribute
		supported by WebKit (Safari) and Blink
		(Chrome) that only applies when the
		type is search. If the attribute is
		present, regardless of what its value
		is, the <input> fires search events as
		the user edits the text value. The
		event is only fired after an
		implementation-defined timeout has
		elapsed since the most recent
		keystroke, and new keystrokes reset the
		timeout. In other words, the event
		firing is debounced. If the attribute
		is absent, the search event is only
		fired when the user explicitly
		initiates a search (e.g. by pressing
		the Enter key while within field).
mozactionhint 	Specifies an "action hint" used to
		determine how to label the enter key on
		mobile devices with virtual keyboards.
		Supported values are go, done, next,
		search, and send. These automatically
		get mapped to the appropriate string
		and are case-insensitive.
results 	This is a nonstandard attribute
		supported by Safari that only applies
		when the type is search. It is used to
		control the maximum number of entries
		that should be displayed in the
		<input>'s native dropdown list of past
		search queries. Its value should be a
		nonnegative decimal integer.
webkitdirectory This Boolean attribute indicates if the
		selector used when the type attribute
		is file has to allow for the selection
		of directories only.
x-moz-errormessage This Mozilla extension allows you to
		specify the error message to display
		when a field doesn't successfully
		validate.

You can style <input> elements using various
color-related attributes in particular. One unusual one
that is specific to text entry-related elements is the
CSS caret-color property, which lets you set the color
used to draw the text input caret:
	HTML:
	<label for="textInput">Note the red
			       caret:</label>
	<input id="textInput" class="custom"
				  size="32"/>
	CSS:
	input.custom {
	  caret-color: red;
	  font: 16px "Helvetica", "Arial", "sans-serif"
	}

SANDBOX (HTML5; for <IFRAME>)
If specified as an empty string, this attribute enables
extra restrictions on the content that can appear in
the inline frame. The value of the attribute can either
be an empty string (all the restrictions are applied),
or a space-separated list of tokens that lift
particular restrictions. Valid tokens are:

allow-forms:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to submit
	forms. If this keyword is not used, this
	operation is not allowed.
allow-modals:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to open
	modal windows.
allow-orientation-lock:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to disable
	the ability to lock the screen orientation.
allow-pointer-lock:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to use the
	Pointer Lock API.
allow-popups:
	Allows popups (like from window.open,
	target="_blank", showModalDialog). If this
	keyword is not used, that functionality will
	silently fail.
allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox:
	Allows a sandboxed document to open new windows
	without forcing the sandboxing flags upon them.
	This will allow, for example, a third-party
	advertisement to be safely sandboxed without
	forcing the same restrictions upon a landing
	page.
allow-presentation:
	Allows embedders to have control over whether
	an iframe can start a presentation session.
allow-same-origin:
	Allows the content to be treated as being from
	its normal origin. If this keyword is not used,
	the embedded content is treated as being from a
	unique origin.
allow-scripts:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to run
	scripts (but not create pop-up windows). If
	this keyword is not used, this operation is not
	allowed.
allow-top-navigation:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to
	navigate (load) content to the top-level
	browsing context. If this keyword is not used,
	this operation is not allowed.
allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation:
	Allows the embedded browsing context to
	navigate (load) content to the top-level
	browsing context only when initiated by a user
	gesture. If this keyword is not used, this
	operation is not allowed.
