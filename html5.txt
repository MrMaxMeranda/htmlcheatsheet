HTML elements reference

This page lists all the HTML elements. They are grouped
by function to help you find what you have in mind
easily.

For more information about the basics of HTML elements
and attributes, see the section on elements in the
Introduction to HTML article.

MAIN ROOT:
<html>		The HTML <html> element represents the
		root (top-level element) of an HTML
		document, so it is also referred to as
		the root element. All other elements
		must be descendants of this element.

DOCUMENT METADATA:
Information about the page: Styles, scripts and data to
help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and
render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be
defined in the page or link to another file that has
the information.
<link> 		element specifies relationships between
		the current document and an external
		resource. Possible uses for this
		element include defining a relational
		framework for navigation. This element
		is most used to link to style sheets.
<meta> 		represents metadata that cannot be
		represented by other HTML meta-related
		elements, like <base>, <link>,
		<script>, <style> or <title>.
<style> 	contains style information for a
		document, or part of a document.

SECTIONING ROOT
<body>		represents the content of an HTML
		document. There can be only one <body>
		element in a document.

CONTENT SECTIONING

Allows you to organize the document content into
logical pieces. Use this to create a broad outline for
your page content, including header and footer
navigation, and heading elements to identify sections
of content.
<address>	Indicates that the enclosed HTML
		provides contact information for a
		person or people, or for an
		organization.supplies contact
		information for its nearest <article>
		or <body> ancestor; in the latter case,
		it applies to the whole document.
<article>	represents a self-contained composition
		in a document, page, application, or
		site, which is intended to be
		independently distributable or reusable
		(e.g., in syndication). Examples
		include: a forum post, a magazine or
		newspaper article, or a blog entry.
<aside> 	represents a portion of a document
		whose content is only indirectly
		related to the document's main content.
<footer> 	The HTML <footer> element represents a
		footer for its nearest sectioning
		content or sectioning root element. A
		footer typically contains information
		about the author of the section,
		copyright data or links to related
		documents.
<header> 	represents introductory content,
		typically a group of introductory or
		navigational aids. It may contain some
		heading elements but also other
		elements like a logo, a search form, an
		author name, and so on.
<h1>, <h2>,	The HTML <h1>–<h6> elements represent
<h3>, <h4>,	six levels of section headings. <h1> is
<h5>, <h6> 	the highest section level and <h6> is
		the lowest.
<hgroup>	represents a multi-level heading for a
		section of a document. It groups a set
		of <h1>–<h6> elements.
<nav>		represents a section of a page whose
		purpose is to provide navigation links,
		either within the current document or
		to other documents.  Common examples of
		navigation sections are menus, tables
		of contents, and indexes.
<section>	represents a standalone section — which
		doesn't have a more specific semantic
		element to represent it — contained
		within an HTML document.

TEXT CONTENT:

Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or
sections of content placed between the opening <body>
and closing </body> tags. Important for accessibility
and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or
structure of that content.
<blockquote> 	indicates that the enclosed text is an
		extended quotation. Usually, this is
		rendered visually by indentation (see
		Notes for how to change it). A URL for
		the source of the quotation may be
		given using the cite attribute, while a
		text representation of the source can
		be given using the <cite> element.
<dd> 		provides the details about or the
		definition of the preceding term (<dt>)
		in a description list (<dl>).
<div> 		generic container for flow content. It
		has no effect on the content or layout
		until styled using CSS.
<dl>		represents a description list. The
		element encloses a list of groups of
		terms (specified using the <dt>
		element) and descriptions. (provided by
		<dd> elements).  Common uses for this
		element are to implement a glossary or
		to display metadata (a list of
		key-value pairs).
<dt> 		specifies a term in a description or
		definition list, and as such must be
		used inside a <dl> element.
<figcaption> 	represents a caption or a legend
		associated with a figure or an
		illustration described by the rest of
		the data of the <figure> element which
		is its immediate ancestor.
<figure>	represents self-contained content,
		frequently with a caption
		(<figcaption>), and is typically
		referenced as a single unit.
<hr>		represents a thematic break between
		paragraph-level elements (for example,
		a change of scene in a story, or a
		shift of topic with a section);
		historically, this has been presented
		as a horizontal rule or line.
<li> 		is used to represent an item in a list.
		It must be contained in a parent
		element: an ordered list (<ol>), an
		unordered list (<ul>), or a menu
		(<menu>). In menus and unordered lists,
		list items are usually displayed using
		bullet points. In ordered lists, they
		are usually displayed with an ascending
		counter on the left, such as a number
		or letter.
<main>		represents the main content of the
		<body> of a document, portion of a
		document, or application. The main
		content area consists of content that
		is directly related to, or expands upon
		the central topic of, a document or the
		central functionality of an
		application.
<ol>		represents an ordered list of items,
		typically rendered as a numbered list.
<p>		represents a paragraph of text.
<pre> 		represents preformatted text which is
		to be presented exactly as written in
		the HTML file.
<ul>		represents an unordered list of items,
		typically rendered as a bulleted list.

INLINE TEXT SEMANTICS

Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the
meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any
arbitrary piece of text.
<a>		creates a hyperlink to other web pages,
		files, locations within the same page,
		email addresses, or any other URL.
<abbr>		represents an abbreviation and
		optionally provides a full description
		for it. If present, the title attribute
		must contain this full description and
		nothing else.
<b>		is used to draw the reader's attention
		to the element's contents, which are
		not otherwise granted special
		importance.
<bdi>		isolates a span of text that might be
		formatted in a different direction from
		other text outside it.
<bdo>		overrides the current directionality of
		text, so that the text within is
		rendered in a different direction.
<br>		The HTML <br> element produces a line
		break in text (carriage-return). It is
		useful for writing a poem or an
		address, where the division of lines is
		significant.
<cite>		is used to describe a reference to a
		cited creative work, and must include
		either the title or the URL of that
		work.
<code>		displays its contents styled in a
		fashion intended to indicate that the
		text is a short fragment of computer
		code.
<data>		links a given content with a
		machine-readable translation. If the
		content is time- or date-related, the
		<time> element must be used.
<dfn>		is used to mark the usage instance of
		the enclosed term which is itself
		included within the definition of that
		term.
<em>		marks text that has stress emphasis.
		The <em> element can be nested, with
		each level of nesting indicating a
		greater degree of emphasis.
<i>		represents a range of text that is set
		off from the normal text for some
		reason, for example, technical terms,
		foreign language phrases, or fictional
		character thoughts. It is typically
		displayed in italic type.
<kbd>		The HTML <kbd> element represents user
		input and produces an inline element
		displayed in the browser's default
		monospace font.
<mark>		represents highlighted text, i.e., a
		run of text marked for reference
		purpose, due to its relevance in a
		particular context.
<q>		indicates that the enclosed text is a
		short inline quotation. Most modern
		browsers implement this by surrounding
		the text in quotation marks.
<rp>		(Ruby Fallback Parenthesis) element is
		used to provide fall-back parentheses
		for browsers that do not support
		display of ruby annotations using the
		<ruby> element.
<rt>		(HTML Ruby Text) element specifies the
		ruby text component of a ruby
		annotation, which is used to provide
		pronunciation, translation, or
		transliteration information for East
		Asian typography. The <rt> element must
		always be contained within a <ruby>
		element.
<rtc>		(HTML Ruby Text Container) element
		embraces semantic annotations of
		characters presented in a ruby of <rb>
		elements used inside of <ruby> element.
		<rb> elements can have both
		pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic
		(<rtc>) annotations.
<ruby>		represents a ruby annotation. Ruby
		annotations are for showing
		pronunciation of East Asian characters.
<s>		renders text with a strikethrough, or a
		line through it. Use the <s> element to
		represent things that are no longer
		relevant or no longer accurate.
		However, <s> is not appropriate when
		indicating document edits; for that,
		use the <del> and <ins> elements, as
		appropriate.
<samp>		The HTML <samp> element is an element
		intended to identify sample output from
		a computer program. It is usually
		displayed in the browser's default
		monotype font (such as Lucida Console).
<small> 	makes the text font size one size
		smaller (for example, from large to
		medium, or from small to x-small) down
		to the browser's minimum font size.  In
		HTML5, this element is repurposed to
		represent side-comments and small
		print, including copyright and legal
		text, independent of its styled
		presentation.
<span>		generic inline container for phrasing
		content, which does not inherently
		represent anything. It can be used to
		group elements for styling purposes
		(using the class or id attributes), or
		because they share attribute values,
		such as lang.
<strong> 	gives text strong importance and is
typically displayed in bold.  <sub> 	The HTML <sub>
element defines a span of text that should be
displayed, for typographic reasons, lower, and often
smaller, than the main span of text.  <sup> 	The
HTML <sup> element defines a span of text that should
be displayed, for typographic reasons, higher, and
often smaller, than the main span of text.  <time>
The HTML <time> element represents either a time on a
24-hour clock or a precise date in the Gregorian
calendar (with optional time and timezone information).
<u> 	The HTML <u> element renders text with an
underline, a line under the baseline of its content. In
HTML5, this element represents a span of text with an
unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual
annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper
name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or
labeling the text as being misspelled.  <var> 	The
HTML <var> element represents a variable in a
mathematical expression or a programming context.
<wbr> 	The HTML <wbr> element represents a word break
opportunity—a position within text where the browser
may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking
rules would not otherwise create a break at that
location.

HTML supports various multimedia resources such as
images, audio, and video.  Element 	Description
<area> 	The HTML <area> element defines a hot-spot
region on an image, and optionally associates it with a
hypertext link. This element is used only within a
<map> element.  <audio> 	The HTML <audio>
element is used to embed sound content in documents. It
may contain one or more audio sources, represented
using the src attribute or the <source> element: the
browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also
be the destination for streamed media, using a
MediaStream.  <img> 	The HTML <img> element embeds
an image into the document.  <map> 	The HTML <map>
element is used with <area> elements to define an image
map (a clickable link area).  <track> 	The HTML
<track> element is used as a child of the media
elements <audio> and <video>. It lets you specify timed
text tracks (or time-based data), for example to
automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are
formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) — Web Video
Text Tracks.  <video> 	Use the HTML <video> element to
embed video content in a document.  Embedded content

In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can
include a variety of other content, even if it's not
always easy to interact with.  Element 	Description
<applet> 	The obsolete HTML Applet Element
(<applet>) embeds a Java applet into the document; this
element has been deprecated in favor of <object>.
<embed> 	The HTML <embed> element embeds
external content at the specified point in the
document. This content is provided by an external
application or other source of interactive content such
as a browser plug-in.  <noembed> 	The <noembed>
element is an obsolete, non-standard way to provide
alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that
do not support the <embed> element or do not support
the type of embedded content an author wishes to use.
<object> 	The HTML <object> element represents an
external resource, which can be treated as an image, a
nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by
a plugin.  <param> 	The HTML <param> element
defines parameters for an <object> element.  <picture>
The HTML <picture> element serves as a container for
zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to
provide versions of an image for different display
device scenarios.  <source> 	The HTML <source>
element specifies multiple media resources for the
<picture>, the <audio> element, or the <video> element.
It is an empty element. It is commonly used to serve
the same media content in multiple formats supported by
different browsers.  Scripting

In order to create dynamic content and Web
applications, HTML supports the use of scripting
languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain
elements support this capability.  Element
Description <canvas> 	Use the HTML <canvas> element
with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API
to draw graphics and animations.  <noscript> 	The
HTML <noscript> element defines a section of HTML to be
inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or
if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.
<script> 	The HTML <script> element is used to
embed or reference executable code; this is typically
used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.  Demarcating
edits

These elements let you provide indications that
specific parts of the text have been altered.  Element
Description <del> 	The HTML <del> element
represents a range of text that has been deleted from a
document.  <ins> 	The HTML <ins> element
represents a range of text that has been added to a
document.  Table content

The elements here are used to create and handle tabular
data.  Element 	Description <caption> 	The HTML Table
Caption element (<caption>) specifies the caption (or
title) of a table, and if used is always the first
child of a <table>.  <col> 	The HTML <col> element
defines a column within a table and is used for
defining common semantics on all common cells. It is
generally found within a <colgroup> element.
<colgroup> 	The HTML <colgroup> element defines a
group of columns within a table.  <table> 	The
HTML <table> element represents tabular data — that is,
information presented in a two-dimensional table
comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
<tbody> 	The HTML <tbody> element groups one or
more <tr> elements as the body of a <table> element.
<td> 	The HTML <td> element defines a cell of a table
that contains data. It participates in the table model.
<tfoot> 	The HTML <tfoot> element defines a set
of rows summarizing the columns of the table.  <th>
The HTML <th> element defines a cell as header of a
group of table cells. The exact nature of this group is
defined by the scope and headers attributes.  <thead>
The HTML <thead> element defines a set of rows defining
the head of the columns of the table.  <tr> 	The
HTML <tr> element specifies that the markup contained
inside the <tr> block comprises one row of a table,
inside which the <th> and <td> elements create header
and data cells, respectively, within the row.  Forms

HTML provides a number of elements which can be used
together to create forms which the user can fill out
and submit to the Web site or application. There's a
great deal of further information about this available
in the HTML forms guide.  Element 	Description
<button> 	The HTML <button> element represents a
clickable button, which can be used in forms, or
anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard
button functionality.  <datalist> 	The HTML
<datalist> element contains a set of <option> elements
that represent the values available for other controls.
<fieldset> 	The HTML <fieldset> element is used to
group several controls as well as labels (<label>)
within a web form.  <form> 	The HTML <form> element
represents a document section that contains interactive
controls to submit information to a web server.
<input> 	The HTML <input> element is used to
create interactive controls for web-based forms in
order to accept data from the user.  <label> 	The
HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item
in a user interface.  <legend> 	The HTML <legend>
element represents a caption for the content of its
parent <fieldset>.  <meter> 	The HTML <meter>
element represents either a scalar value within a known
range or a fractional value.  <optgroup> 	The
HTML <optgroup> element creates a grouping of options
within a <select> element.  <option> 	The HTML
<option> element is used to define an item contained in
a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As
such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and
other lists of items in an HTML document.  <output>
The HTML Output element (<output>) is a container
element into which a site or app can inject the results
of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.
<progress> 	The HTML <progress> element displays an
indicator showing the completion progress of a task,
typically displayed as a progress bar.  <select>
The HTML <select> element represents a control that
provides a menu of options: <textarea> 	The HTML
<textarea> element represents a multi-line plain-text
editing control.  Interactive elements

HTML offers a selection of elements which help to
create interactive user interface objects.  Element
Description <details> 	The HTML <details> element is
used as a disclosure widget from which the user can
retrieve additional information.  <dialog> 	The
HTML <dialog> element represents a dialog box or other
interactive component, such as an inspector or window.
<menu> 	The HTML <menu> element represents a group of
commands that a user can perform or activate. This
includes both list menus, which might appear across the
top of a screen, as well as context menus, such as
those that might appear underneath a button after it
has been clicked.  <menuitem> 	The HTML <menuitem>
element represents a command that a user is able to
invoke through a popup menu. This includes context
menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a
menu button.  <summary> 	The HTML <summary>
element is used as a summary, caption, or legend for
the content of a <details> element.  Web Components

Web Components is an HTML-related technology which
makes it possible to, essentially, create and use
custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In
addition, you can create custom versions of standard
HTML elements.  Element 	Description <content>
The HTML <content> element—an obsolete part of the Web
Components suite of technologies—was used inside of
Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to
be used in ordinary HTML.  <element> 	The obsolete
HTML <element> element was part of the Web Components
specification; it was intended to be used to define new
custom DOM elements.  <shadow> 	The HTML <shadow>
element—an obsolete part of the Web Components
technology suite—was intended to be used as a shadow
DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have
created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. It
is not useful in ordinary HTML.  <slot> 	The
HTML <slot> element—part of the Web Components
technology suite—is a placeholder inside a web
component that you can fill with your own markup, which
lets you create separate DOM trees and present them
together.  <template> 	The HTML <template> element is
a mechanism for holding client-side content that is not
to be rendered when a page is loaded but may
subsequently be instantiated during runtime using
JavaScript.  Obsolete and deprecated elements

Warning: These are old HTML elements which are
deprecated and should not be used. You should never use
them in new projects, and should replace them in old
projects as soon as you can. They are listed here for
informational purposes only.  Element 	Description
<acronym> 	The HTML Acronym Element (<acronym>)
allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of
characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for
a word. This element has been removed in HTML5. Use
<abbr> element.  <applet> 	The obsolete HTML
Applet Element (<applet>) embeds a Java applet into the
document; this element has been deprecated in favor of
<object>.  <basefont> 	The obsolete HTML Base Font
element (<basefont>) sets a default font face, size,
and color for the other elements which are descended
from its parent element.  <bgsound> 	The Internet
Explorer only HTML Background Sound element (<bgsound>)
sets up a sound file to play in the background while
the page is used; use <audio> instead.  <big> 	The
obsolete HTML Big Element (<big>) renders the enclosed
text at a font size one level larger than the
surrounding text (medium becomes large, for example).
<blink> 	The HTML Blink Element (<blink>) is a
non-standard element which causes the enclosed text to
flash slowly.  <center> 	The obsolete HTML
Center Element (<center>) is a block-level element that
displays its block-level or inline contents centered
horizontally within its containing element.  <command>
The HTML Command element (<command>) represents a
command which the user can invoke. Commands are often
used as part of a context menu or toolbar.  <content>
The HTML <content> element—an obsolete part of the Web
Components suite of technologies—was used inside of
Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to
be used in ordinary HTML.  <dir> 	The obsolete
HTML Directory element (<dir>) is used as a container
for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially
with styles and icons applied by the user agent.
<element> 	The obsolete HTML <element> element was
part of the Web Components specification; it was
intended to be used to define new custom DOM elements.
<font> 	The HTML Font Element (<font>) defines the font
size, color and face for its content.  <frame> 	<frame>
is an HTML element which defines a particular area in
which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame
should be used within a <frameset>.  <frameset>
<frameset> is an HTML element which is used to contain
<frame> elements.  <image> 	The HTML <image>
element is an obsolete remnant of an ancient version of
HTML lost in the mists of time; use the standard <img>
element instead. Seriously, the specification even
literally uses the words "Don't ask" when describing
this element.  <isindex> 	<isindex> is an
obsolete HTML element that puts a text field in a page
for querying the document.  <keygen> 	The HTML
<keygen> element exists to facilitate generation of key
material, and submission of the public key as part of
an HTML form. This mechanism is designed for use with
Web-based certificate management systems. It is
expected that the <keygen> element will be used in an
HTML form along with other information needed to
construct a certificate request, and that the result of
the process will be a signed certificate.  <listing>
The HTML Listing Element (<listing>) renders text
between the start and end tags without interpreting the
HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML 2
standard recommended that lines shouldn't be broken
when not greater than 132 characters.  <marquee>
The HTML <marquee> element is used to insert a
scrolling area of text. You can control what happens
when the text reaches the edges of its content area
using its attributes.  <multicol> 	The HTML
<multicol> element was an experimental element designed
to allow multi-column layouts. It never got any
significant traction and is not implemented in any
major browsers.  <nextid> 	<nextid> is an obsolete
HTML element that served to enable the NeXT web
designing tool to generate automatic NAME labels for
its anchors.  <nobr> 	The non-standard, obsolete HTML
<nobr> element prevents the text it contains from
automatically wrapping accross multiple lines,
potentially resulting in the user having to scroll
horizontally to see the entire width of the text.
<noembed> 	The <noembed> element is an obsolete,
non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback",
content for browsers that do not support the <embed>
element or do not support the type of embedded content
an author wishes to use.  <noframes> 	The obsolete
HTML No Frames or frame fallback element, <noframes>,
provides content to be presented in browsers that don't
support (or have disabled support for) the <frame>
element.  <plaintext> 	The HTML Plaintext Element
(<plaintext>) renders everything following the start
tag as raw text, without interpreting any HTML. There
is no closing tag, since everything after it is
considered raw text.  <shadow> 	The HTML <shadow>
element—an obsolete part of the Web Components
technology suite—was intended to be used as a shadow
DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have
created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. It
is not useful in ordinary HTML.  <spacer>
<spacer> is an obsolete HTML element which allowed
insertion of empty spaces on pages. It was devised by
Netscape to accomplish the same effect as a
single-pixel layout image, which was something web
designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages
without actually using an image. However, <spacer> no
longer supported by any major browser and the same
effects can now be achieved using simple CSS.  <strike>
The HTML <strike> element (or HTML Strikethrough
Element) places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over
text.  <tt> 	The HTML Teletype Text Element (<tt>)
produces an inline element displayed in the browser's
default monotype font. This element was intended to
style text as it would display on a fixed width
display, such as a teletype. It probably is more common
to display fixed width type using the <code> element.
<xmp> 	The HTML Example Element (<xmp>) renders text
between the start and end tags without interpreting the
HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2
specification recommended that it should be rendered
wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.
