BEST PRACTICES FOR <H1> to <H6>
Always add a heading to explicit sectioning content.
Try not to rely on implicit sectioning, use <section>,
<article>, etc. instead of just <h1>, <h2>, etc.

<body>
    <h1>Apples</h1>
    <p>Apples are fruit.</p>
    <section>
         <h2>Taste</h2>
         <p>They taste lovely.</p>
         <section>
             <h3>Sweet</h3>
	     <p>Red apples are sweeter than green.</p>
         </section>
    </section>
    <section>
         <h2>Colour</h2>
         <p>Apples come in various colours.</p>
    </section>
</body>

EMBEDDING A TABLE OF CONTENTS
Visualizing the table of contents is useful for
debugging the structure of your page, and checking the
presence of headings after sectioning content
