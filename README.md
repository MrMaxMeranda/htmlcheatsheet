HTML Text-only Reference

This reference is very similar to my CSS3 Cheat Sheet 
https://github.com/MrMaxMeranda/csscheatsheet
in that it was pre-written in text so that I could enter it into my A5 notebook with a pencil. I will be using this book as a reference for a course that I am doing in HTML5.

As of now, this document is not so much "a work in progress" as I have written what is here in my notebook already (yes, it took a few afternoons of my time). This means that I now have less interest in keeping this 'up to date'. It would be useful for someone that is interested in going in a similar direction as I have, but I would think that such people would be few and far between.

If you have any use for this document, feel free to use it as I have only copied most of this here from MDN (
